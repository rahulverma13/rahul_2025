I think these memes made the lessons easier to follow and understand. Below are the few that I really liked :) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5431245a-b6bf-4c8a-bd5f-0dea4265c3dc) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/233ae048-1967-45a2-a2a3-8a95a33b2e8b) Also, I really liked working with Shuban, Eric, and Aadit. We have known each other for some time and it was fun engaging in this project together. Below is a picture taken of us :) ![IMG_2919 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d9fb434-e269-444d-bd95-e078d3577340)  |\n",

It was the first in the class to give some sort of incentive to participate, and the dunking despite the bloodshed was really fun: people learned that shots were not the best option but rather dunking. It even came down to the last shot in a final shoot out. There were definitely places where we could have improved--I think we should have divided it into more groups to have everyone be more engaged, and also optimized for time so everyone wasn't halfway out the door when the final shootout was going on. Despite this, I think this part brought a really fun aspect to our lesson :)  |\n",
