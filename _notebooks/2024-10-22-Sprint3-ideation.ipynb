    "Our team's project is developing CSA Synergy to help Mr. Mortensen by providing a portal for students to submit assignments as well as grade their team teach's homework. This portal will greatly simplify the process of submitting grades on a google sheet, simplying both the students and the teacher's busy work. Furthermore, it will provide additional features like a Smart Calendar and Grade Analytics to help the students.\n",
