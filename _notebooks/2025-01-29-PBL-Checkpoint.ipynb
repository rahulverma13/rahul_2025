    "# Project Based Learning Review 1/29\n",
    "\n",
    "## What have I done over the last few weeks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before winter break, we had created a basic, barely functional \"Synergy\" System. However, there were many fatal flaws with this that led it to not be useable. Over the past few weeks, we have been working on making this system fully functional, cumulating in **it's usage in team teaches (starting with the 2D Arrays Pt. 2 Team Teach)**. Below, I will go over my contributions to this part of the project.\n",

    "Overall, I believe I have demonstrated a strong commitment to this project in working through issues to get our feature to be functional and usable for the team teaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Progress Updates: What has changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. \"Assign to Grade\" Feature (Largest Change)\n",
    "For our initial feature, we hadn't thought through the entire process of how the feature would work. For students to be able to grade assignments, a teacher must be able to \"assign\" certain students to be \"graders\" for certain assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This caused large changes to the code structure. I created a many to many relationship on the backend, connecting students to assignments if the teacher assigns them. See here:\n",
    "<img width=\"1510\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3431bb01-a9bd-46a4-a6f0-59042144e3de\" />\n",
    "Furthermore, the search bar enables the teacher to search through the long list of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature was done in collaboration with **Akhil & Aadit**. They created the frontend page which enabled students to be able to grade the assignments that they are assigned to, overall creating a full stack effective feature that works for the team teaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"864\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57cb2972-48fa-4ad8-9f09-a159235a3eff\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"1427\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ccce327-98f3-4a8a-9f68-283c156f9f14\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Progress: The checklist needs to and update it self to check for which students have already been assigned, right now the checklist is a complete reset every time you open up the website*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unification/Connection of AssignmentSubmission & SynergyGrades database values\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the last 2 weeks, there was a disconnect between ``AssignmentSubmission`` and ``SynergyGrades``. When the teacher would grade an assignment, it would get connected to the submission, but not in the grades because they are seperate. To fix this, I worked on connecting the AssignmentSubmission feature to additionally save to SynergyGrades. This applies when the teacher grades the assignment in student or teacher mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "We considered consolidating these two classes into one, but decided not too because there may be many submissions, but only 1 grade for the assignment. Thus, this opted as the simplest & most effective option to avoid this disconnect between Grades and Submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Connecting Student Comments to Teacher Grading\n",
    "In collaboration with Kayden, I connected his comments submission to showing up on the teacher grading assignments page. With the teacher also being able to assign feedback, this creates a multifaceted comment system: students can submit comments with their submission, and then the teacher can submit comments back.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the comments that the students put here for their issue submission!\n",
    "<img width=\"484\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/016d27b5-501f-45e9-9188-9bd68f23cedc\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Progress: Need to make space for submission longer to avoid overflow on the assignment submission page*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration of Usage in Last 2 Weeks!\n",
    "Here are the screens which I have worked on, with full users demonstrating how our feature is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to create the assignments for PBL Review for the separate periods, as well as the homework submission for 2D Arrays Pt. 2\n",
    "<img width=\"845\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de2818b-a639-4b88-a7f9-7020ca066a0b\" />\n",
    "Submissions can be viewed in teacher mode: \n",
    "<img width=\"881\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e027f5af-a136-4b32-a23c-843bc4e3a89f\" />\n",
    "Submissions can be graded/viewen in student mode or teacher mode\n",

    "\n",
    "## Future Improvements Required\n",
    "1. Checklist should NOT reset every time it's opened (Small task)\n",
    "2. Increase space for text of submission when viewed by teacher (links can be long) (Small task)\n",
    "3. Separate students into classes and have assignments, submissions, & grades be managed separately for each period."
