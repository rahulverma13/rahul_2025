    "1. \n",
    "You can represent a weighted graph using an adjacency list by instead of just having 0s and 1s make it so a 0 represents no edge and instead of a 1 we represent the weight of the graph.\n",
    "You can do it with a vertex set by instead of having a set of items that are length of 2, make it a set of items of length 3 where the 3rd item is the weight.\n",
    "You can do it with an edge set in basically the same way but in a map just have it a tuple essentially of length 2 where the first item is the node and the second item is the weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "You can represent a directed graph through an adjacency list by not putting a 1 for both orderings of row/col, like if theres just an edge between node 1 and node 2 only do 1 to 2, not from 2 to 1.\n",
    "Its basically the same thing for a vertex and edge set where you only do it one way and not the other, so like the first value is the origin and the second value is where its going to.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code for 3 is below:"
